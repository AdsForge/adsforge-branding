# AdsForge AI

> Launch Meta Ads from plain English.

AdsForge AI is an intelligent automation platform designed to simplify digital marketing. It allows users to create, launch, and optimize Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram) by simply describing their goals in natural language.

## Core Capabilities

- **Natural Language Campaign Creation**: Users can state their intent (e.g., "I want to sell more sneakers to men in New York with a $50 daily budget"), and AdsForge configures the campaign settings, audience targeting, and budget allocation automatically.
- **Creative Analysis & Optimization**: Upload ad creatives to receive AI-driven insights on performance potential. The system can suggest improvements or alternative copy.
- **Automated Management**: Once launched, AdsForge monitors campaign performance and makes real-time adjustments to maximize Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).

## How It Works

1. **Describe**: Tell the AI your marketing objective.
2. **Upload**: Provide your image or video assets.
3. **Launch**: Review the generated campaign structure and publish with one click.
